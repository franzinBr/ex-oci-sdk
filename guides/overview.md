# Introduction to ExOciSdk

Welcome to ExOciSdk! This guide introduces an Elixir SDK for working with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). If you're looking to interact with OCI services using Elixir, this library aims to make that process straightforward and familiar.

## What is ExOciSdk?

ExOciSdk is an open-source SDK that helps Elixir developers work with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. It provides a way to interact with OCI services using Elixir patterns and practices you're already familiar with. The goal is simple: make working with OCI in Elixir feel natural.

Some common use cases include:
- Managing cloud resources from your Elixir applications
- Automating infrastructure tasks
- Integrating OCI services into your existing Elixir projects
- Building tools and utilities for OCI management

## Why We Created ExOciSdk

While OCI provides excellent SDKs for several languages, we saw an opportunity to create something specifically for the Elixir community. This SDK aims to:

### Work with Elixir, Not Against It
We've designed the SDK to follow Elixir conventions and practices. This means you can write code that feels natural in your Elixir applications.

### Keep Things Simple
Cloud infrastructure can be complex enough - your tools shouldn't add to that complexity. We focus on:
- Clear, predictable interfaces
- Helpful error messages
- Practical documentation with examples
- Sensible defaults while maintaining flexibility

### Provide Room to Grow
As your needs evolve, the SDK offers ways to adapt:
- Customize how HTTP requests are handled
- Configure JSON processing
- Build your own abstractions on top

## Before You Begin

To use ExOciSdk, you'll need:

1. An active Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account
2. Basic familiarity with OCI concepts
3. Proper OCI credentials and permissions
4. Elixir installed on your system
